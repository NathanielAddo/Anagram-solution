# Collaborative Problem Solving: The Anagram Dilemma

## Introduction
Welcome to our collaborative effort to tackle the anagram problem! Anagrams are fascinating puzzles, but solving them can present numerous challenges, especially when working in a group. This README aims to highlight some common problems and compromises that arise during our collaborative journey towards finding a solution.

## The Anagram Problem
An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase. For example, "listen" is an anagram of "silent". Our goal is to develop an efficient algorithm that can identify anagrams within a given set of words.

## Problems Encountered
### 1. Algorithm Complexity
One of the initial hurdles we faced was determining the most efficient algorithm for detecting anagrams. Different team members proposed various approaches, each with its own trade-offs in terms of time complexity and space complexity.

### 2. Data Structure Selection
Choosing the right data structure to store and manipulate the words proved to be another challenge. Should we use arrays, hash maps, or trees? Each data structure comes with its own advantages and limitations, and reaching a consensus required careful consideration of the problem requirements and performance implications.


### 3. Collaboration Coordination
Collaborating effectively in a group setting also posed its own set of challenges. Communication was a bit diffficult since the electricity outbreak rendered our devices useless...Pushing to the branches was very also challenging

## Compromises Made
### 1. Algorithm Selection
To move forward, we had to make compromises on the algorithm selection. 

### 2. Trade-offs in Data Structures
Similarly, we had to make trade-offs in our choice of data structures. We compromised by implementing a flexible data structure that could adapt based on the size of the input.


### 3. Collaboration
To streamline collaboration, we adopted agile practices such as phone calls instead of texts. This allowed us to quickly adapt to changing requirements and incorporate feedback from team members.

## Conclusion
The journey of solving the anagram problem as a group taught us valuable lessons in problem-solving, teamwork, and compromise. By navigating through the challenges together and making informed decisions, we were able to develop a solution that met our goals effectively. We hope that sharing our experiences will inspire and guide others facing similar collaborative endeavors.
